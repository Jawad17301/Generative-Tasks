His parents were \\nvery hard- working and deeply religious people, but so poor \\nthat they lived with their five children in only two rooms. \\nThe father and mother spent their evenings in reading aloud \\nto their children, generally from books of a serious charac-\\nter.\\nThough always sickly and delicate Dostoevsky came out \\nthird in the final examination of the Petersburg school of \\nEngineering. There he had already begun his first work, \\n‘Poor Folk.’\\nThis story was published by the poet Nekrassov in his \\nreview and was received with acclamations. The shy, un-\\nknown youth found himself instantly something of a \\ncelebrity. A brilliant and successful career seemed to open \\nbefore him, but those hopes were soon dashed. In 1849 he \\nwas arrested.\\nThough neither by temperament nor conviction a revolu-\\ntionist, Dostoevsky was one of a little group of young men \\nwho met together to read Fourier and Proudhon. He was ac-\\ncused of ‘taking part in conversations against the censorship, \\nof reading a letter from Byelinsky to Gogol, and of knowing \\nof the intention to set up a printing press.’ Under Nicholas I. \\n\\n\\uf646\\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com\\n(that ‘stern and just man,’ as Maurice Baring calls him) this \\nwas enough, and he was condemned to death. After eight \\nmonths’ imprisonment he was with twenty-one others tak-\\nen out to the Semyonovsky Square to be shot. Writing to his \\nbrother Mihail, Dostoevsky says: ‘They snapped words over \\nour heads, and they made us put on the white shirts worn by \\npersons condemned to death. Thereupon we were bound in \\nthrees to stakes, to suffer execution. Being the third in the \\nrow, I concluded I had only a few minutes of life before me. \\nI thought of you and your dear ones and I contrived to kiss \\nPlestcheiev and Dourov, who were next to me, and to bid \\nthem farewell. Suddenly the troops beat a tattoo, we were \\nunbound, brought back upon the scaffold, and informed \\nthat his Majesty had spared us our lives.’ The sentence was \\ncommuted to hard labour.\\nOne of the prisoners, Grigoryev, went mad as soon as he \\nwas untied, and never regained his sanity.\\nThe intense suffering of this experience left a lasting \\nstamp on Dostoevsky’s mind. Though his religious temper \\nled him in the end to accept every suffering with resignation \\nand to regard it as a blessing in his own case, he constantly \\nrecurs to the subject in his writings. He describes the awful \\nagony of the condemned man and insists on the cruelty of \\ninflicting such torture. Then followed four years of penal \\nservitude, spent in the company of common criminals in \\nSiberia, where he began the ‘Dead House,’ and some years \\nof service in a disciplinary battalion.\\nHe had shown signs of some obscure nervous disease be-\\nfore his arrest and this now developed into violent attacks of'),\n",

The \\nfits occurred three or four times a year and were more fre-\\nquent in periods of great strain. In 1859 he was allowed to \\nreturn to Russia. He started a journal— ‘Vremya,’ which was \\nforbidden by the Censorship through a misunderstanding. \\nIn 1864 he lost his first wife and his brother Mihail. He was \\nin terrible poverty, yet he took upon himself the payment \\nof his brother’s debts. He started another journal—‘The Ep-\\noch,’ which within a few months was also prohibited. He \\nwas weighed down by debt, his brother’s family was depen-\\ndent on him, he was forced to write at heart-breaking speed, \\nand is said never to have corrected his work. The later years \\nof his life were much softened by the tenderness and devo-\\ntion of his second wife.\\nIn June 1880 he made his famous speech at the unveil-\\ning of the monument to Pushkin in Moscow and he was \\nreceived with extraordinary demonstrations of love and \\nhonour.\\nA few months later Dostoevsky died. He was followed to \\nthe grave by a vast multitude of mourners, who ‘gave the \\nhapless man the funeral of a king.’ He is still probably the \\nmost widely read writer in Russia.\\nIn the words of a Russian critic, who seeks to explain the \\nfeeling inspired by Dostoevsky: ‘He was one of ourselves, a \\nman of our blood and our bone, but one who has suffered \\nand has seen so much more deeply than we have his insight \\nimpresses us as wisdom … that wisdom of the heart which \\nwe seek that we may learn from it how to live. All his other \\ngifts came to him from nature, this he won for himself and \\n\\n\\uf648\\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com\\nthrough it he became great.’\\n\\nCrime and Punishment\\n\\uf649\\nPart I\\n\\n\\uf64a\\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com\\nChapter I\\nO\\nn an exceptionally hot evening early in July a young \\nman came out of the garret in which he lodged in S. \\nPlace and walked slowly, as though in hesitation, towards \\nK. bridge.\\nHe had successfully avoided meeting his landlady on the \\nstaircase. His garret was under the roof of a high, five-sto-\\nried house and was more like a cupboard than a room. The \\nlandlady who provided him with garret, dinners, and at-\\ntendance, lived on the floor below, and every time he went \\nout he was obliged to pass her kitchen, the door of which \\ninvariably stood open. And each time he passed, the young \\nman had a sick, frightened feeling, which made him scowl \\nand feel ashamed. He was hopelessly in debt to his landlady, \\nand was afraid of meeting her.\\nThis was not because he was cowardly and abject, quite \\nthe contrary; but for some time past he had been in an over-\\nstrained irritable condition, verging on hypochondria. He \\nhad become so completely absorbed in himself, and iso-\\nlated from his fellows that he dreaded meeting, not only \\nhis landlady, but anyone at all. He was crushed by poverty, \\nbut the anxieties of his position had of late ceased to weigh \\nupon him. He had given up attending to matters of practi-\\ncal importance; he had lost all desire to do so. Nothing that \\nany landlady could do had a real terror for him. But to be'),\n",

It would be interesting to know what it is \\nmen are most afraid of. Taking a new step, uttering a new \\nword is what they fear most…. But I am talking too much. \\nIt’s because I chatter that I do nothing. Or perhaps it is that \\nI chatter because I do nothing. I’ve learned to chatter this \\nlast month, lying for days together in my den thinking … \\nof Jack the Giant-killer. Why am I going there now? Am I \\ncapable of that? Is that serious? It is not serious at all. It’s \\nsimply a fantasy to amuse myself; a plaything! Yes, maybe \\nit is a plaything.’\\nThe heat in the street was terrible: and the airlessness, the \\nbustle and the plaster, scaffolding, bricks, and dust all about \\nhim, and that special Petersburg stench, so familiar to all \\nwho are unable to get out of town in summer—all worked \\npainfully upon the young man’s already overwrought \\nnerves. The insufferable stench from the pot- houses, which \\nare particularly numerous in that part of the town, and the \\ndrunken men whom he met continually, although it was a \\nworking day, completed the revolting misery of the picture. \\n\\n\\uf64c\\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com\\nAn expression of the profoundest disgust gleamed for a mo-\\nment in the young man’s refined face. He was, by the way, \\nexceptionally handsome, above the average in height, slim, \\nwell-built, with beautiful dark eyes and dark brown hair. \\nSoon he sank into deep thought, or more accurately speak-\\ning into a complete blankness of mind; he walked along not \\nobserving what was about him and not caring to observe it. \\nFrom time to time, he would mutter something, from the \\nhabit of talking to himself, to which he had just confessed. \\nAt these moments he would become conscious that his ideas \\nwere sometimes in a tangle and that he was very weak; for \\ntwo days he had scarcely tasted food.\\nHe was so badly dressed that even a man accustomed to \\nshabbiness would have been ashamed to be seen in the street \\nin such rags. In that quarter of the town, however, scarce-\\nly any shortcoming in dress would have created surprise. \\nOwing to the proximity of the Hay Market, the number of \\nestablishments of bad character, the preponderance of the \\ntrading and working class population crowded in these \\nstreets and alleys in the heart of Petersburg, types so vari-\\nous were to be seen in the streets that no figure, however \\nqueer, would have caused surprise. But there was such accu-\\nmulated bitterness and contempt in the young man’s heart, \\nthat, in spite of all the fastidiousness of youth, he minded \\nhis rags least of all in the street. It was a different matter \\nwhen he met with acquaintances or with former fellow stu-\\ndents, whom, indeed, he disliked meeting at any time.

It was a tall round hat \\nfrom Zimmerman’s, but completely worn out, rusty with \\nage, all torn and bespattered, brimless and bent on one side \\nin a most unseemly fashion. Not shame, however, but quite \\nanother feeling akin to terror had overtaken him.\\n‘I knew it,’ he muttered in confusion, ‘I thought so! That’s \\nthe worst of all! Why, a stupid thing like this, the most trivial \\ndetail might spoil the whole plan. Yes, my hat is too notice-\\nable…. It looks absurd and that makes it noticeable…. With \\nmy rags I ought to wear a cap, any sort of old pancake, but \\nnot this grotesque thing. Nobody wears such a hat, it would \\nbe noticed a mile off, it would be remembered…. What mat-\\nters is that people would remember it, and that would give \\nthem a clue. For this business one should be as little con-\\nspicuous as possible…. Trifles, trifles are what matter! Why, \\nit’s just such trifles that always ruin everything….’\\nHe had not far to go; he knew indeed how many steps \\nit was from the gate of his lodging house: exactly seven \\nhundred and thirty. He had counted them once when he \\nhad been lost in dreams. At the time he had put no faith \\nin those dreams and was only tantalising himself by their \\nhideous but daring recklessness. Now, a month later, he had \\nbegun to look upon them differently, and, in spite of the \\nmonologues in which he jeered at his own impotence and \\nindecision, he had involuntarily come to regard this ‘hid-\\neous’ dream as an exploit to be attempted, although he still \\n\\n11\\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com\\ndid not realise this himself. He was positively going now for \\na ‘rehearsal’ of his project, and at every step his excitement \\ngrew more and more violent.\\nWith a sinking heart and a nervous tremor, he went up \\nto a huge house which on one side looked on to the canal, \\nand on the other into the street. This house was let out in \\ntiny tenements and was inhabited by working people of all \\nkinds—tailors, locksmiths, cooks, Germans of sorts, girls \\npicking up a living as best they could, petty clerks, etc. There \\nwas a continual coming and going through the two gates \\nand in the two courtyards of the house. Three or four door-\\nkeepers were employed on the building. The young man \\nwas very glad to meet none of them, and at once slipped un-\\nnoticed through the door on the right, and up the staircase. \\nIt was a back staircase, dark and narrow, but he was familiar \\nwith it already, and knew his way, and he liked all these sur-\\nroundings: in such darkness even the most inquisitive eyes \\nwere not to be dreaded.\\n‘If I am so scared now, what would it be if it somehow \\ncame to pass that I were really going to do it?’ he could not \\nhelp asking himself as he reached the fourth storey. There \\nhis progress was barred by some porters who were engaged \\nin moving furniture out of a flat. He knew that the flat had \\nbeen occupied by a German clerk in the civil service, and \\nhis family. This German was moving out then, and so the \\nfourth floor on this staircase would be untenanted except by \\nthe old woman. ‘That’s a good thing anyway,’ he thought to \\nhimself, as he rang the bell of the old woman’s flat. The bell \\ngave a faint tinkle as though it were made of tin and not of'),\n",

He had forgotten the note of that bell, and \\nnow its peculiar tinkle seemed to remind him of something \\nand to bring it clearly before him…. He started, his nerves \\nwere terribly overstrained by now. In a little while, the door \\nwas opened a tiny crack: the old woman eyed her visitor \\nwith evident distrust through the crack, and nothing could \\nbe seen but her little eyes, glittering in the darkness. But, \\nseeing a number of people on the landing, she grew bolder, \\nand opened the door wide. The young man stepped into the \\ndark entry, which was partitioned off from the tiny kitch-\\nen. The old woman stood facing him in silence and looking \\ninquiringly at him. She was a diminutive, withered up old \\nwoman of sixty, with sharp malignant eyes and a sharp lit-\\ntle nose. Her colourless, somewhat grizzled hair was thickly \\nsmeared with oil, and she wore no kerchief over it. Round \\nher thin long neck, which looked like a hen’s leg, was knot-\\nted some sort of flannel rag, and, in spite of the heat, there \\nhung flapping on her shoulders, a mangy fur cape, yellow \\nwith age. The old woman coughed and groaned at every in-\\nstant. The young man must have looked at her with a rather \\npeculiar expression, for a gleam of mistrust came into her \\neyes again.\\n‘Raskolnikov, a student, I came here a month ago,’ the \\nyoung man made haste to mutter, with a half bow, remem-\\nbering that he ought to be more polite.\\n‘I remember, my good sir, I remember quite well your \\ncoming here,’ the old woman said distinctly, still keeping \\nher inquiring eyes on his face.\\n\\n1\\uf646\\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com\\n‘And here … I am again on the same errand,’ Raskol-\\nnikov continued, a little disconcerted and surprised at \\nthe old woman’s mistrust. ‘Perhaps she is always like that \\nthough, only I did not notice it the other time,’ he thought \\nwith an uneasy feeling.\\nThe old woman paused, as though hesitating; then \\nstepped on one side, and pointing to the door of the room, \\nshe said, letting her visitor pass in front of her:\\n‘Step in, my good sir.’\\nThe little room into which the young man walked, with \\nyellow paper on the walls, geraniums and muslin curtains \\nin the windows, was brightly lighted up at that moment by \\nthe setting sun.\\n‘So the sun will shine like this then too!’ flashed as it were \\nby chance through Raskolnikov’s mind, and with a rapid \\nglance he scanned everything in the room, trying as far as \\npossible to notice and remember its arrangement. But there \\nwas nothing special in the room. The furniture, all very old \\nand of yellow wood, consisted of a sofa with a huge bent \\nwooden back, an oval table in front of the sofa, a dressing-\\ntable with a looking-glass fixed on it between the windows, \\nchairs along the walls and two or three half-penny prints in \\nyellow frames, representing German damsels with birds in \\ntheir hands—that was all. In the corner a light was burning \\nbefore a small ikon. Everything was very clean; the floor and \\nthe furniture were brightly polished; everything shone.\\n‘Lizaveta’s work,’ thought the young man. There was not \\na speck of dust to be seen in the whole flat.\\n‘It’s in the houses of spiteful old widows that one finds'),\n",

These two rooms made up the whole flat.\\n‘What do you want?’ the old woman said severely, com-\\ning into the room and, as before, standing in front of him so \\nas to look him straight in the face.\\n‘I’ve brought something to pawn here,’ and he drew out \\nof his pocket an old-fashioned flat silver watch, on the back \\nof which was engraved a globe; the chain was of steel.\\n‘But the time is up for your last pledge. The month was up \\nthe day before yesterday.’\\n‘I will bring you the interest for another month; wait a \\nlittle.’\\n‘But that’s for me to do as I please, my good sir, to wait or \\nto sell your pledge at once.’\\n‘How much will you give me for the watch, Alyona Iva-\\nnovna?’\\n‘You come with such trifles, my good sir, it’s scarcely \\nworth anything. I gave you two roubles last time for your \\nring and one could buy it quite new at a jeweler’s for a rou-\\nble and a half.’\\n‘Give me four roubles for it, I shall redeem it, it was my \\nfather’s. I shall be getting some money soon.’\\n‘A rouble and a half, and interest in advance, if you like!’\\n‘A rouble and a half!’ cried the young man.\\n‘Please yourself’—and the old woman handed him back \\nthe watch. The young man took it, and was so angry that he \\n\\n1\\uf648\\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com\\nwas on the point of going away; but checked himself at once, \\nremembering that there was nowhere else he could go, and \\nthat he had had another object also in coming.\\n‘Hand it over,’ he said roughly.\\nThe old woman fumbled in her pocket for her keys, and \\ndisappeared behind the curtain into the other room. The \\nyoung man, left standing alone in the middle of the room, \\nlistened inquisitively, thinking. He could hear her unlock-\\ning the chest of drawers.\\n‘It must be the top drawer,’ he reflected. ‘So she carries \\nthe keys in a pocket on the right. All in one bunch on a steel \\nring…. And there’s one key there, three times as big as all \\nthe others, with deep notches; that can’t be the key of the \\nchest of drawers … then there must be some other chest or \\nstrong-box … that’s worth knowing. Strong-boxes always \\nhave keys like that … but how degrading it all is.’\\nThe old woman came back.\\n‘Here, sir: as we say ten copecks the rouble a month, so \\nI must take fifteen copecks from a rouble and a half for the \\nmonth in advance. But for the two roubles I lent you before, \\nyou owe me now twenty copecks on the same reckoning \\nin advance. That makes thirty-five copecks altogether. So \\nI must give you a rouble and fifteen copecks for the watch. \\nHere it is.’\\n‘What! only a rouble and fifteen copecks now!’\\n‘Just so.’\\nThe young man did not dispute it and took the money. \\nHe looked at the old woman, and was in no hurry to get \\naway, as though there was still something he wanted to say'),\n",

You are too \\nquick…. Good-day, Alyona Ivanovna.’\\nRaskolnikov went out in complete confusion. This con-\\nfusion became more and more intense. As he went down the \\nstairs, he even stopped short, two or three times, as though \\nsuddenly struck by some thought. When he was in the street \\nhe cried out, ‘Oh, God, how loathsome it all is! and can I, \\ncan I possibly…. No, it’s nonsense, it’s rubbish!’ he added \\nresolutely. ‘And how could such an atrocious thing come \\ninto my head? What filthy things my heart is capable of. Yes, \\nfilthy above all, disgusting, loathsome, loathsome!—and for \\na whole month I’ve been….’ But no words, no exclamations, \\ncould express his agitation. The feeling of intense repulsion, \\nwhich had begun to oppress and torture his heart while he \\nwas on his way to the old woman, had by now reached such \\na pitch and had taken such a definite form that he did not \\nknow what to do with himself to escape from his wretched-\\nness. He walked along the pavement like a drunken man, \\nregardless of the passers-by, and jostling against them, and \\n\\n1\\uf64a\\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com\\nonly came to his senses when he was in the next street. Look-\\ning round, he noticed that he was standing close to a tavern \\nwhich was entered by steps leading from the pavement to \\nthe basement. At that instant two drunken men came out \\nat the door, and abusing and supporting one another, they \\nmounted the steps. Without stopping to think, Raskolnikov \\nwent down the steps at once. Till that moment he had never \\nbeen into a tavern, but now he felt giddy and was tormented \\nby a burning thirst. He longed for a drink of cold beer, and \\nattributed his sudden weakness to the want of food. He sat \\ndown at a sticky little table in a dark and dirty corner; or-\\ndered some beer, and eagerly drank off the first glassful. At \\nonce he felt easier; and his thoughts became clear.\\n‘All that’s nonsense,’ he said hopefully, ‘and there is noth-\\ning in it all to worry about! It’s simply physical derangement. \\nJust a glass of beer, a piece of dry bread—and in one mo-\\nment the brain is stronger, the mind is clearer and the will \\nis firm! Phew, how utterly petty it all is!’\\nBut in spite of this scornful reflection, he was by now \\nlooking cheerful as though he were suddenly set free from \\na terrible burden: and he gazed round in a friendly way at \\nthe people in the room. But even at that moment he had a \\ndim foreboding that this happier frame of mind was also \\nnot normal.\\nThere were few people at the time in the tavern. Besides \\nthe two drunken men he had met on the steps, a group con-\\nsisting of about five men and a girl with a concertina had \\ngone out at the same time.

Such \\nwas the impression made on Raskolnikov by the person sit-\\nting a little distance from him, who looked like a retired \\nclerk. The young man often recalled this impression af-\\nterwards, and even ascribed it to presentiment. He looked \\nrepeatedly at the clerk, partly no doubt because the latter \\nwas staring persistently at him, obviously anxious to enter \\ninto conversation. At the other persons in the room, includ-\\ning the tavern- keeper, the clerk looked as though he were \\nused to their company, and weary of it, showing a shade of \\ncondescending contempt for them as persons of station and \\nculture inferior to his own, with whom it would be useless \\nfor him to converse. He was a man over fifty, bald and griz-\\nzled, of medium height, and stoutly built. His face, bloated \\nfrom continual drinking, was of a yellow, even greenish, \\ntinge, with swollen eyelids out of which keen reddish eyes \\ngleamed like little chinks. But there was something very \\nstrange in him; there was a light in his eyes as though of \\nintense feeling—perhaps there were even thought and intel-\\nligence, but at the same time there was a gleam of something \\nlike madness. He was wearing an old and hopelessly ragged \\nblack dress coat, with all its buttons missing except one, \\nand that one he had buttoned, evidently clinging to this \\nlast trace of respectability. A crumpled shirt front, covered \\nwith spots and stains, protruded from his canvas waistcoat. \\nLike a clerk, he wore no beard, nor moustache, but had been \\nso long unshaven that his chin looked like a stiff greyish \\nbrush. And there was something respectable and like an of-\\nficial about his manner too. But he was restless; he ruffled \\n\\n\\uf6451\\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com\\nup his hair and from time to time let his head drop into his \\nhands dejectedly resting his ragged elbows on the stained \\nand sticky table. At last he looked straight at Raskolnikov, \\nand said loudly and resolutely:\\n‘May I venture, honoured sir, to engage you in polite con-\\nversation? Forasmuch as, though your exterior would not \\ncommand respect, my experience admonishes me that you \\nare a man of education and not accustomed to drinking. I \\nhave always respected education when in conjunction with \\ngenuine sentiments, and I am besides a titular counsellor in \\nrank. Marmeladov—such is my name; titular counsellor. I \\nmake bold to inquire—have you been in the service?’\\n‘No, I am studying,’ answered the young man, some-\\nwhat surprised at the grandiloquent style of the speaker \\nand also at being so directly addressed.

Bits of \\nhay were in fact clinging to his clothes and sticking to his \\nhair. It seemed quite probable that he had not undressed or \\nwashed for the last five days. His hands, particularly, were \\nfilthy. They were fat and red, with black nails.\\nHis conversation seemed to excite a general though lan-\\nguid interest. The boys at the counter fell to sniggering. The \\ninnkeeper came down from the upper room, apparently on \\npurpose to listen to the ‘funny fellow’ and sat down at a \\nlittle distance, yawning lazily, but with dignity. Evidently \\nMarmeladov was a familiar figure here, and he had most \\n\\n\\uf645\\uf646\\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com\\nlikely acquired his weakness for high-flown speeches from \\nthe habit of frequently entering into conversation with \\nstrangers of all sorts in the tavern. This habit develops into \\na necessity in some drunkards, and especially in those who \\nare looked after sharply and kept in order at home. Hence \\nin the company of other drinkers they try to justify them-\\nselves and even if possible obtain consideration.\\n‘Funny fellow!’ pronounced the innkeeper. ‘And why \\ndon’t you work, why aren’t you at your duty, if you are in \\nthe service?’\\n‘Why am I not at my duty, honoured sir,’ Marmeladov \\nwent on, addressing himself exclusively to Raskolnikov, as \\nthough it had been he who put that question to him. ‘Why \\nam I not at my duty? Does not my heart ache to think what \\na useless worm I am? A month ago when Mr. Lebeziatnikov \\nbeat my wife with his own hands, and I lay drunk, didn’t I \\nsuffer? Excuse me, young man, has it ever happened to you \\n… hm … well, to petition hopelessly for a loan?’\\n‘Yes, it has. But what do you mean by hopelessly?’\\n‘Hopelessly in the fullest sense, when you know before-\\nhand that you will get nothing by it. You know, for instance, \\nbeforehand with positive certainty that this man, this most \\nreputable and exemplary citizen, will on no consideration \\ngive you money; and indeed I ask you why should he? For \\nhe knows of course that I shan’t pay it back. From compas-\\nsion? But Mr. Lebeziatnikov who keeps up with modern \\nideas explained the other day that compassion is forbidden \\nnowadays by science itself, and that that’s what is done now \\nin England, where there is political economy. Why, I ask'),\n",

And yet though I know before-\\nhand that he won’t, I set off to him and …’\\n‘Why do you go?’ put in Raskolnikov.\\n‘Well, when one has no one, nowhere else one can go! \\nFor every man must have somewhere to go. Since there are \\ntimes when one absolutely must go somewhere! When my \\nown daughter first went out with a yellow ticket, then I had \\nto go … (for my daughter has a yellow passport),’ he add-\\ned in parenthesis, looking with a certain uneasiness at the \\nyoung man. ‘No matter, sir, no matter!’ he went on hurried-\\nly and with apparent composure when both the boys at the \\ncounter guffawed and even the innkeeper smiled—‘No mat-\\nter, I am not confounded by the wagging of their heads; for \\neveryone knows everything about it already, and all that is \\nsecret is made open. And I accept it all, not with contempt, \\nbut with humility. So be it! So be it! ‘Behold the man!’ Ex-\\ncuse me, young man, can you…. No, to put it more strongly \\nand more distinctly; not can you but dare you, looking upon \\nme, assert that I am not a pig?’\\nThe young man did not answer a word.\\n‘Well,’ the orator began again stolidly and with even in-\\ncreased dignity, after waiting for the laughter in the room \\nto subside. ‘Well, so be it, I am a pig, but she is a lady! I \\nhave the semblance of a beast, but Katerina Ivanovna, my \\nspouse, is a person of education and an officer’s daughter. \\nGranted, granted, I am a scoundrel, but she is a woman of \\na noble heart, full of sentiments, refined by education. And \\nyet … oh, if only she felt for me! Honoured sir, honoured sir, \\nyou know every man ought to have at least one place where \\n\\n\\uf645\\uf648\\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com\\npeople feel for him! But Katerina Ivanovna, though she is \\nmagnanimous, she is unjust…. And yet, although I realise \\nthat when she pulls my hair she only does it out of pity—for \\nI repeat without being ashamed, she pulls my hair, young \\nman,’ he declared with redoubled dignity, hearing the snig-\\ngering again—‘but, my God, if she would but once…. But \\nno, no! It’s all in vain and it’s no use talking! No use talk-\\ning! For more than once, my wish did come true and more \\nthan once she has felt for me but … such is my fate and I am \\na beast by nature!’\\n‘Rather!’ assented the innkeeper yawning. Marmeladov \\nstruck his fist resolutely on the table.\\n‘Such is my fate! Do you know, sir, do you know, I have \\nsold her very stockings for drink? Not her shoes—that \\nwould be more or less in the order of things, but her stock-\\nings, her stockings I have sold for drink!

For \\nin unfolding to you the story of my life, I do not wish to \\nmake myself a laughing-stock before these idle listeners, \\nwho indeed know all about it already, but I am looking for a \\nman of feeling and education. Know then that my wife was \\neducated in a high-class school for the daughters of noble-\\nmen, and on leaving she danced the shawl dance before the \\ngovernor and other personages for which she was presented \\nwith a gold medal and a certificate of merit. The medal … \\nwell, the medal of course was sold—long ago, hm … but the \\ncertificate of merit is in her trunk still and not long ago she \\nshowed it to our landlady. And although she is most con-\\ntinually on bad terms with the landlady, yet she wanted to \\ntell someone or other of her past honours and of the happy \\ndays that are gone. I don’t condemn her for it, I don’t blame \\nher, for the one thing left her is recollection of the past, and \\nall the rest is dust and ashes. Yes, yes, she is a lady of spirit, \\nproud and determined. She scrubs the floors herself and has \\nnothing but black bread to eat, but won’t allow herself to be \\ntreated with disrespect. That’s why she would not overlook \\nMr. Lebeziatnikov’s rudeness to her, and so when he gave \\nher a beating for it, she took to her bed more from the hurt \\nto her feelings than from the blows. She was a widow when I \\nmarried her, with three children, one smaller than the other. \\nShe married her first husband, an infantry officer, for love, \\nand ran away with him from her father’s house. She was \\nexceedingly fond of her husband; but he gave way to cards, \\ngot into trouble and with that he died. He used to beat her \\n\\n\\uf645\\uf64a\\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com\\nat the end: and although she paid him back, of which I have \\nauthentic documentary evidence, to this day she speaks of \\nhim with tears and she throws him up to me; and I am glad, \\nI am glad that, though only in imagination, she should think \\nof herself as having once been happy…. And she was left at \\nhis death with three children in a wild and remote district \\nwhere I happened to be at the time; and she was left in such \\nhopeless poverty that, although I have seen many ups and \\ndowns of all sort, I don’t feel equal to describing it even. Her \\nrelations had all thrown her off. And she was proud, too, \\nexcessively proud…. And then, honoured sir, and then, I, \\nbeing at the time a widower, with a daughter of fourteen \\nleft me by my first wife, offered her my hand, for I could not \\nbear the sight of such suffering. You can judge the extremity \\nof her calamities, that she, a woman of education and cul-\\nture and distinguished family, should have consented to be \\nmy wife. But she did! Weeping and sobbing and wringing \\nher hands, she married me! For she had nowhere to turn! \\nDo you understand, sir, do you understand what it means \\nwhen you have absolutely nowhere to turn? No, that you \\ndon’t understand yet…. And for a whole year, I performed \\nmy duties conscientiously and faithfully, and did not touch \\nthis’ (he tapped the jug with his finger), ‘for I have feelings. \\nBut even so, I could not please her; and then I lost my place \\ntoo, and that through no fault of mine but through changes \\nin the office; and then I did touch it! … It will be a year and \\na half ago soon since we found ourselves at last after many \\nwanderings and numerous calamities in this magnificent \\ncapital, adorned with innumerable monuments.

This time it was through my own fault I lost \\nit: for my weakness had come out…. We have now part of \\na room at Amalia Fyodorovna Lippevechsel’s; and what we \\nlive upon and what we pay our rent with, I could not say. \\nThere are a lot of people living there besides ourselves. Dirt \\nand disorder, a perfect Bedlam … hm … yes … And mean-\\nwhile my daughter by my first wife has grown up; and what \\nmy daughter has had to put up with from her step-mother \\nwhilst she was growing up, I won’t speak of. For, though \\nKaterina Ivanovna is full of generous feelings, she is a spir-\\nited lady, irritable and short—tempered…. Yes. But it’s no \\nuse going over that! Sonia, as you may well fancy, has had \\nno education. I did make an effort four years ago to give her \\na course of geography and universal history, but as I was \\nnot very well up in those subjects myself and we had no \\nsuitable books, and what books we had … hm, anyway we \\nhave not even those now, so all our instruction came to an \\nend. We stopped at Cyrus of Persia.

And now may I ven-\\nture to address you, honoured sir, on my own account with \\na private question. Do you suppose that a respectable poor \\ngirl can earn much by honest work? Not fifteen farthings a \\nday can she earn, if she is respectable and has no special tal-\\nent and that without putting her work down for an instant! \\n\\n\\uf645\\uf64c\\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com\\nAnd what’s more, Ivan Ivanitch Klopstock the civil counsel-\\nlor—have you heard of him?—has not to this day paid her \\nfor the half-dozen linen shirts she made him and drove her \\nroughly away, stamping and reviling her, on the pretext that \\nthe shirt collars were not made like the pattern and were \\nput in askew. And there are the little ones hungry…. And \\nKaterina Ivanovna walking up and down and wringing her \\nhands, her cheeks flushed red, as they always are in that dis-\\nease: ‘Here you live with us,’ says she, ‘you eat and drink and \\nare kept warm and you do nothing to help.’ And much she \\ngets to eat and drink when there is not a crust for the little \\nones for three days! I was lying at the time … well, what of \\nit! I was lying drunk and I heard my Sonia speaking (she \\nis a gentle creature with a soft little voice … fair hair and \\nsuch a pale, thin little face). She said: ‘Katerina Ivanovna, \\nam I really to do a thing like that?’ And Darya Frantsov-\\nna, a woman of evil character and very well known to the \\npolice, had two or three times tried to get at her through \\nthe landlady. ‘And why not?’ said Katerina Ivanovna with \\na jeer, ‘you are something mighty precious to be so careful \\nof!’ But don’t blame her, don’t blame her, honoured sir, don’t \\nblame her! She was not herself when she spoke, but driven \\nto distraction by her illness and the crying of the hungry \\nchildren; and it was said more to wound her than anything \\nelse…. For that’s Katerina Ivanovna’s character, and when \\nchildren cry, even from hunger, she falls to beating them \\nat once. At six o’clock I saw Sonia get up, put on her ker-\\nchief and her cape, and go out of the room and about nine \\no’clock she came back. She walked straight up to Katerina'),\n",

And then \\nI saw, young man, I saw Katerina Ivanovna, in the same si-\\nlence go up to Sonia’s little bed; she was on her knees all the \\nevening kissing Sonia’s feet, and would not get up, and then \\nthey both fell asleep in each other’s arms … together, to-\\ngether … yes … and I … lay drunk.’\\nMarmeladov stopped short, as though his voice had \\nfailed him. Then he hurriedly filled his glass, drank, and \\ncleared his throat.\\n‘Since then, sir,’ he went on after a brief pause—‘Since \\nthen, owing to an unfortunate occurrence and through in-\\nformation given by evil- intentioned persons—in all which \\nDarya Frantsovna took a leading part on the pretext that \\nshe had been treated with want of respect—since then my \\ndaughter Sofya Semyonovna has been forced to take a yel-\\nlow ticket, and owing to that she is unable to go on living \\nwith us. For our landlady, Amalia Fyodorovna would not \\nhear of it (though she had backed up Darya Frantsovna be-\\nfore) and Mr. Lebeziatnikov too … hm…. All the trouble \\nbetween him and Katerina Ivanovna was on Sonia’s ac-\\ncount.

It was all in disorder, littered up with rags of all \\nsorts, especially children’s garments. Across the furthest \\ncorner was stretched a ragged sheet. Behind it probably was \\nthe bed. There was nothing in the room except two chairs \\nand a sofa covered with American leather, full of holes, be-\\nfore which stood an old deal kitchen-table, unpainted and \\nuncovered. At the edge of the table stood a smoldering \\ntallow-candle in an iron candlestick.

She \\nwas a rather tall, slim and graceful woman, terribly emaci-\\nated, with magnificent dark brown hair and with a hectic \\nflush in her cheeks.

She seemed to Raskolnikov \\nabout thirty years old and was certainly a strange wife for \\nMarmeladov…. She had not heard them and did not notice \\nthem coming in. She seemed to be lost in thought, hear-\\ning and seeing nothing. The room was close, but she had \\nnot opened the window; a stench rose from the staircase, \\nbut the door on to the stairs was not closed. From the inner \\nrooms clouds of tobacco smoke floated in, she kept cough-\\ning, but did not close the door. The youngest child, a girl of \\nsix, was asleep, sitting curled up on the floor with her head \\non the sofa. A boy a year older stood crying and shaking in \\nthe corner, probably he had just had a beating. Beside him \\nstood a girl of nine years old, tall and thin, wearing a thin \\nand ragged chemise with an ancient cashmere pelisse flung \\nover her bare shoulders, long outgrown and barely reach-\\ning her knees. Her arm, as thin as a stick, was round her \\nbrother’s neck. She was trying to comfort him, whispering \\nsomething to him, and doing all she could to keep him from \\nwhimpering again. At the same time her large dark eyes, \\nwhich looked larger still from the thinness of her frightened \\nface, were watching her mother with alarm. Marmeladov \\ndid not enter the door, but dropped on his knees in the very \\ndoorway, pushing Raskolnikov in front of him. The woman \\nseeing a stranger stopped indifferently facing him, coming \\nto herself for a moment and apparently wondering what he \\nhad come for. But evidently she decided that he was going \\ninto the next room, as he had to pass through hers to get \\nthere. Taking no further notice of him, she walked towards \\nthe outer door to close it and uttered a sudden scream on \\n\\n\\uf6471\\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com\\nseeing her husband on his knees in the doorway.\\n‘Ah!’ she cried out in a frenzy, ‘he has come back! The \\ncriminal! the monster! … And where is the money? What’s \\nin your pocket, show me! And your clothes are all different! \\nWhere are your clothes? Where is the money! Speak!’\\nAnd she fell to searching him. Marmeladov submissively \\nand obediently held up both arms to facilitate the search. \\nNot a farthing was there.\\n‘Where is the money?’ she cried—‘Mercy on us, can he \\nhave drunk it all? There were twelve silver roubles left in the \\nchest!’ and in a fury she seized him by the hair and dragged \\nhim into the room. Marmeladov seconded her efforts by \\nmeekly crawling along on his knees.\\n‘And this is a consolation to me! This does not hurt me, \\nbut is a positive con-so-la-tion, ho-nou-red sir,’ he called \\nout, shaken to and fro by his hair and even once striking \\nthe ground with his forehead. The child asleep on the floor \\nwoke up, and began to cry. The boy in the corner losing all \\ncontrol began trembling and screaming and rushed to his \\nsister in violent terror, almost in a fit. The eldest girl was \\nshaking like a leaf.\\n‘He’s drunk it! he’s drunk it all,’ the poor woman \\nscreamed in despair —‘and his clothes are gone!

Coarse laughing faces with pipes \\nand cigarettes and heads wearing caps thrust themselves in \\nat the doorway. Further in could be seen figures in dress-\\ning gowns flung open, in costumes of unseemly scantiness, \\nsome of them with cards in their hands. They were particu-\\nlarly diverted, when Marmeladov, dragged about by his hair, \\nshouted that it was a consolation to him.

In the first place, would you have \\nguessed, dear Rodya, that your sister has been living with \\nme for the last six weeks and we shall not be separated in \\nthe future. Thank God, her sufferings are over, but I will tell \\nyou everything in order, so that you may know just how ev-\\nerything has happened and all that we have hitherto \\nconcealed from you. When you wrote to me two months \\nago that you had heard that Dounia had a great deal to put \\nup with in the Svidrigraïlovs’ house, when you wrote that \\nand asked me to tell you all about it—what could I write in \\nanswer to you? If I had written the whole truth to you, I \\ndare say you would have thrown up everything and have \\ncome to us, even if you had to walk all the way, for I know \\nyour character and your feelings, and you would not let \\nyour sister be insulted. I was in despair myself, but what \\ncould I do? And, besides, I did not know the whole truth \\nmyself then. What made it all so difficult was that Dounia \\nreceived a hundred roubles in advance when she took the \\nplace as governess in their family, on condition of part of \\nher salary being deducted every month, and so it was im-\\npossible to throw up the situation without repaying the \\ndebt. This sum (now I can explain it all to you, my precious \\nRodya) she took chiefly in order to send you sixty roubles, \\nwhich you needed so terribly then and which you received \\nfrom us last year. We deceived you then, writing that this \\nmoney came from Dounia’s savings, but that was not so, \\nand now I tell you all about it, because, thank God, things \\nhave suddenly changed for the better, and that you may \\nknow how Dounia loves you and what a heart she has. At \\n\\nCrime and Punishment\\n\\uf6480\\nfirst indeed Mr. Svidrigaïlov treated her very rudely and \\nused to make disrespectful and jeering remarks at table…. \\nBut I don’t want to go into all those painful details, so as not \\nto worry you for nothing when it is now all over. In short, in \\nspite of the kind and generous behaviour of Marfa Petrovna, \\nMr. Svidrigaïlov’s wife, and all the rest of the household, \\nDounia had a very hard time, especially when Mr. Svidriga-\\nïlov, relapsing into his old regimental habits, was under the \\ninfluence of Bacchus. And how do you think it was all ex-\\nplained later on? Would you believe that the crazy fellow \\nhad conceived a passion for Dounia from the beginning, \\nbut had concealed it under a show of rudeness and con-\\ntempt. Possibly he was ashamed and horrified himself at his \\nown flighty hopes, considering his years and his being the \\nfather of a family; and that made him angry with Dounia. \\nAnd possibly, too, he hoped by his rude and sneering behav-\\niour to hide the truth from others. But at last he lost all \\ncontrol and had the face to make Dounia an open and \\nshameful proposal, promising her all sorts of inducements \\nand offering, besides, to throw up everything and take her \\nto another estate of his, or even abroad. You can imagine all \\nshe went through! To leave her situation at once was impos-\\nsible not only on account of the money debt, but also to \\nspare the feelings of Marfa Petrovna, whose suspicions \\nwould have been aroused: and then Dounia would have \\nbeen the cause of a rupture in the family. And it would have \\nmeant a terrible scandal for Dounia too; that would have \\nbeen inevitable. There were various other reasons owing to \\nwhich Dounia could not hope to escape from that awful'),\n",

You know Dounia, of course; \\nyou know how clever she is and what a strong will she has. \\nDounia can endure a great deal and even in the most diffi-\\ncult cases she has the fortitude to maintain her firmness. \\nShe did not even write to me about everything for fear of \\nupsetting me, although we were constantly in communica-\\ntion. It all ended very unexpectedly. Marfa Petrovna \\naccidentally overheard her husband imploring Dounia in \\nthe garden, and, putting quite a wrong interpretation on \\nthe position, threw the blame upon her, believing her to be \\nthe cause of it all. An awful scene took place between them \\non the spot in the garden; Marfa Petrovna went so far as to \\nstrike Dounia, refused to hear anything and was shouting \\nat her for a whole hour and then gave orders that Dounia \\nshould be packed off at once to me in a plain peasant’s cart, \\ninto which they flung all her things, her linen and her \\nclothes, all pell-mell, without folding it up and packing it. \\nAnd a heavy shower of rain came on, too, and Dounia, in-\\nsulted and put to shame, had to drive with a peasant in an \\nopen cart all the seventeen versts into town. Only think \\nnow what answer could I have sent to the letter I received \\nfrom you two months ago and what could I have written? I \\nwas in despair; I dared not write to you the truth because \\nyou would have been very unhappy, mortified and indig-\\nnant, and yet what could you do? You could only perhaps \\nruin yourself, and, besides, Dounia would not allow it; and \\nfill up my letter with trifles when my heart was so full of \\nsorrow, I could not. For a whole month the town was full of \\ngossip about this scandal, and it came to such a pass that \\n\\nCrime and Punishment\\n\\uf648\\uf645\\nDounia and I dared not even go to church on account of the \\ncontemptuous looks, whispers, and even remarks made \\naloud about us. All our acquaintances avoided us, nobody \\neven bowed to us in the street, and I learnt that some shop-\\nmen and clerks were intending to insult us in a shameful \\nway, smearing the gates of our house with pitch, so that the \\nlandlord began to tell us we must leave. All this was set go-\\ning by Marfa Petrovna who managed to slander Dounia \\nand throw dirt at her in every family. She knows everyone \\nin the neighbourhood, and that month she was continually \\ncoming into the town, and as she is rather talkative and \\nfond of gossiping about her family affairs and particularly \\nof complaining to all and each of her husband—which is \\nnot at all right —so in a short time she had spread her story \\nnot only in the town, but over the whole surrounding dis-\\ntrict. It made me ill, but Dounia bore it better than I did, \\nand if only you could have seen how she endured it all and \\ntried to comfort me and cheer me up! She is an angel! But by \\nGod’s mercy, our sufferings were cut short: Mr. Svidrigaïlov \\nreturned to his senses and repented and, probably feeling \\nsorry for Dounia, he laid before Marfa Petrovna a complete \\nand unmistakable proof of Dounia’s innocence, in the form \\nof a letter Dounia had been forced to write and give to him, \\nbefore Marfa Petrovna came upon them in the garden. This \\nletter, which remained in Mr. Svidrigaïlov’s hands after her \\ndeparture, she had written to refuse personal explanations \\nand secret interviews, for which he was entreating her. In \\nthat letter she reproached him with great heat and indigna-\\ntion for the baseness of his behaviour in regard to Marfa'),\n",

Indeed, dear Rodya, the letter was so nobly and \\ntouchingly written that I sobbed when I read it and to this \\nday I cannot read it without tears. Moreover, the evidence \\nof the servants, too, cleared Dounia’s reputation; they had \\nseen and known a great deal more than Mr. Svidrigaïlov \\nhad himself supposed —as indeed is always the case with \\nservants. Marfa Petrovna was completely taken aback, and \\n‘again crushed’ as she said herself to us, but she was com-\\npletely convinced of Dounia’s innocence. The very next day, \\nbeing Sunday, she went straight to the Cathedral, knelt \\ndown and prayed with tears to Our Lady to give her strength \\nto bear this new trial and to do her duty. Then she came \\nstraight from the Cathedral to us, told us the whole story, \\nwept bitterly and, fully penitent, she embraced Dounia and \\nbesought her to forgive her. The same morning without any \\ndelay, she went round to all the houses in the town and ev-\\nerywhere, shedding tears, she asserted in the most flattering \\nterms Dounia’s innocence and the nobility of her feelings \\nand her behavior. What was more, she showed and read to \\neveryone the letter in Dounia’s own handwriting to Mr. \\nSvidrigaïlov and even allowed them to take copies of it—\\nwhich I must say I think was superfluous. In this way she \\nwas busy for several days in driving about the whole town, \\nbecause some people had taken offence through precedence \\nhaving been given to others. And therefore they had to take \\nturns, so that in every house she was expected before she ar-\\n\\nCrime and Punishment\\n\\uf648\\uf647\\nrived, and everyone knew that on such and such a day \\nMarfa Petrovna would be reading the letter in such and \\nsuch a place and people assembled for every reading of it, \\neven many who had heard it several times already both in \\ntheir own houses and in other people’s. In my opinion a \\ngreat deal, a very great deal of all this was unnecessary; but \\nthat’s Marfa Petrovna’s character. Anyway she succeeded in \\ncompletely re-establishing Dounia’s reputation and the \\nwhole ignominy of this affair rested as an indelible disgrace \\nupon her husband, as the only person to blame, so that I re-\\nally began to feel sorry for him; it was really treating the \\ncrazy fellow too harshly. Dounia was at once asked to give \\nlessons in several families, but she refused. All of a sudden \\neveryone began to treat her with marked respect and all \\nthis did much to bring about the event by which, one may \\nsay, our whole fortunes are now transformed. You must \\nknow, dear Rodya, that Dounia has a suitor and that she has \\nalready consented to marry him. I hasten to tell you all \\nabout the matter, and though it has been arranged without \\nasking your consent, I think you will not be aggrieved with \\nme or with your sister on that account, for you will see that \\nwe could not wait and put off our decision till we heard \\nfrom you.

He is a very busy man and is in a great hurry to get \\nto Petersburg, so that every moment is precious to him. At \\nfirst, of course, we were greatly surprised, as it had all hap-\\npened so quickly and unexpectedly. We thought and talked \\nit over the whole day. He is a well-to-do man, to be depend-\\ned upon, he has two posts in the government and has already \\nmade his fortune. It is true that he is forty-five years old, but \\nhe is of a fairly prepossessing appearance and might still be \\nthought attractive by women, and he is altogether a very re-\\nspectable and presentable man, only he seems a little morose \\nand somewhat conceited. But possibly that may only be the \\nimpression he makes at first sight. And beware, dear Rodya, \\nwhen he comes to Petersburg, as he shortly will do, beware \\nof judging him too hastily and severely, as your way is, if \\nthere is anything you do not like in him at first sight. I give \\nyou this warning, although I feel sure that he will make a \\nfavourable impression upon you. Moreover, in order to un-\\nderstand any man one must be deliberate and careful to \\navoid forming prejudices and mistaken ideas, which are \\nvery difficult to correct and get over afterwards. And Pyotr \\nPetrovitch, judging by many indications, is a thoroughly es-\\ntimable man. At his first visit, indeed, he told us that he was \\na practical man, but still he shares, as he expressed it, many \\nof the convictions ‘of our most rising generation’ and he is \\nan opponent of all prejudices. He said a good deal more, for \\nhe seems a little conceited and likes to be listened to, but \\nthis is scarcely a vice. I, of course, understood very little of \\n\\nCrime and Punishment\\n\\uf648\\uf649\\nit, but Dounia explained to me that, though he is not a man \\nof great education, he is clever and seems to be good-na-\\ntured. You know your sister’s character, Rodya. She is a \\nresolute, sensible, patient and generous girl, but she has a \\npassionate heart, as I know very well. Of course, there is no \\ngreat love either on his side, or on hers, but Dounia is a clev-\\ner girl and has the heart of an angel, and will make it her \\nduty to make her husband happy who on his side will make \\nher happiness his care. Of that we have no good reason to \\ndoubt, though it must be admitted the matter has been ar-\\nranged in great haste. Besides he is a man of great prudence \\nand he will see, to be sure, of himself, that his own happi-\\nness will be the more secure, the happier Dounia is with \\nhim. And as for some defects of character, for some habits \\nand even certain differences of opinion —which indeed are \\ninevitable even in the happiest marriages— Dounia has \\nsaid that, as regards all that, she relies on herself, that there \\nis nothing to be uneasy about, and that she is ready to put \\nup with a great deal, if only their future relationship can be \\nan honourable and straightforward one. He struck me, for \\ninstance, at first, as rather abrupt, but that may well come \\nfrom his being an outspoken man, and that is no doubt how \\nit is. For instance, at his second visit, after he had received \\nDounia’s consent, in the course of conversation, he declared \\nthat before making Dounia’s acquaintance, he had made up \\nhis mind to marry a girl of good reputation, without dowry \\nand, above all, one who had experienced poverty, because, \\nas he explained, a man ought not to be indebted to his wife, \\nbut that it is better for a wife to look upon her husband as'),\n",

I must add that he expressed it more nicely \\nand politely than I have done, for I have forgotten his actual \\nphrases and only remember the meaning. And, besides, it \\nwas obviously not said of design, but slipped out in the heat \\nof conversation, so that he tried afterwards to correct him-\\nself and smooth it over, but all the same it did strike me as \\nsomewhat rude, and I said so afterwards to Dounia. But \\nDounia was vexed, and answered that ‘words are not deeds,’ \\nand that, of course, is perfectly true. Dounia did not sleep \\nall night before she made up her mind, and, thinking that I \\nwas asleep, she got out of bed and was walking up and down \\nthe room all night; at last she knelt down before the ikon \\nand prayed long and fervently and in the morning she told \\nme that she had decided.\\n‘I have mentioned already that Pyotr Petrovitch is just \\nsetting off for Petersburg, where he has a great deal of busi-\\nness, and he wants to open a legal bureau. He has been \\noccupied for many years in conducting civil and commer-\\ncial litigation, and only the other day he won an important \\ncase. He has to be in Petersburg because he has an impor-\\ntant case before the Senate. So, Rodya dear, he may be of the \\ngreatest use to you, in every way indeed, and Dounia and I \\nhave agreed that from this very day you could definitely en-\\nter upon your career and might consider that your future is \\nmarked out and assured for you. Oh, if only this comes to \\npass! This would be such a benefit that we could only look \\nupon it as a providential blessing. Dounia is dreaming of \\nnothing else. We have even ventured already to drop a few \\nwords on the subject to Pyotr Petrovitch. He was cautious in \\n\\nCrime and Punishment\\n\\uf648\\uf64b\\nhis answer, and said that, of course, as he could not get on \\nwithout a secretary, it would be better to be paying a salary \\nto a relation than to a stranger, if only the former were fitted \\nfor the duties (as though there could be doubt of your being \\nfitted!) but then he expressed doubts whether your studies \\nat the university would leave you time for work at his office. \\nThe matter dropped for the time, but Dounia is thinking of \\nnothing else now. She has been in a sort of fever for the last \\nfew days, and has already made a regular plan for your be-\\ncoming in the end an associate and even a partner in Pyotr \\nPetrovitch’s business, which might well be, seeing that you \\nare a student of law. I am in complete agreement with her, \\nRodya, and share all her plans and hopes, and think there \\nis every probability of realising them. And in spite of Pyotr \\nPetrovitch’s evasiveness, very natural at present (since he \\ndoes not know you), Dounia is firmly persuaded that she \\nwill gain everything by her good influence over her future \\nhusband; this she is reckoning upon. Of course we are care-\\nful not to talk of any of these more remote plans to Pyotr \\nPetrovitch, especially of your becoming his partner. He is a \\npractical man and might take this very coldly, it might all \\nseem to him simply a day-dream. Nor has either Dounia or \\nI breathed a word to him of the great hopes we have of his \\nhelping us to pay for your university studies; we have not \\nspoken of it in the first place, because it will come to pass of \\nitself, later on, and he will no doubt without wasting words \\noffer to do it of himself, (as though he could refuse Dounia \\nthat) the more readily since you may by your own efforts be-\\ncome his right hand in the office, and receive this assistance'),\n",

And we have not spoken of our plans for another \\nreason, that is, because I particularly wanted you to feel on \\nan equal footing when you first meet him. When Dounia \\nspoke to him with enthusiasm about you, he answered that \\none could never judge of a man without seeing him close, \\nfor oneself, and that he looked forward to forming his own \\nopinion when he makes your acquaintance. Do you know, \\nmy precious Rodya, I think that perhaps for some reasons \\n(nothing to do with Pyotr Petrovitch though, simply for my \\nown personal, perhaps old- womanish, fancies) I should do \\nbetter to go on living by myself, apart, than with them, af-\\nter the wedding. I am convinced that he will be generous \\nand delicate enough to invite me and to urge me to remain \\nwith my daughter for the future, and if he has said nothing \\nabout it hitherto, it is simply because it has been taken for \\ngranted; but I shall refuse. I have noticed more than once \\nin my life that husbands don’t quite get on with their moth-\\ners-in- law, and I don’t want to be the least bit in anyone’s \\nway, and for my own sake, too, would rather be quite inde-\\npendent, so long as I have a crust of bread of my own, and \\nsuch children as you and Dounia. If possible, I would set-\\ntle somewhere near you, for the most joyful piece of news, \\ndear Rodya, I have kept for the end of my letter: know then, \\nmy dear boy, that we may, perhaps, be all together in a very \\nshort time and may embrace one another again after a sep-\\naration of almost three years! It is settled for certain that \\nDounia and I are to set off for Petersburg, exactly when I \\n\\nCrime and Punishment\\n\\uf6490\\ndon’t know, but very, very soon, possibly in a week. It all \\ndepends on Pyotr Petrovitch who will let us know when he \\nhas had time to look round him in Petersburg. To suit his \\nown arrangements he is anxious to have the ceremony as \\nsoon as possible, even before the fast of Our Lady, if it could \\nbe managed, or if that is too soon to be ready, immediate-\\nly after. Oh, with what happiness I shall press you to my \\nheart! Dounia is all excitement at the joyful thought of see-\\ning you, she said one day in joke that she would be ready to \\nmarry Pyotr Petrovitch for that alone. She is an angel! She \\nis not writing anything to you now, and has only told me \\nto write that she has so much, so much to tell you that she \\nis not going to take up her pen now, for a few lines would \\ntell you nothing, and it would only mean upsetting herself; \\nshe bids me send you her love and innumerable kisses. But \\nalthough we shall be meeting so soon, perhaps I shall send \\nyou as much money as I can in a day or two. Now that ev-\\neryone has heard that Dounia is to marry Pyotr Petrovitch, \\nmy credit has suddenly improved and I know that Afanasy \\nIvanovitch will trust me now even to seventy-five roubles \\non the security of my pension, so that perhaps I shall be able \\nto send you twenty-five or even thirty roubles. I would send \\nyou more, but I am uneasy about our travelling expenses; \\nfor though Pyotr Petrovitch has been so kind as to under-\\ntake part of the expenses of the journey, that is to say, he \\nhas taken upon himself the conveyance of our bags and big \\ntrunk (which will be conveyed through some acquaintanc-\\nes of his), we must reckon upon some expense on our arrival \\nin Petersburg, where we can’t be left without a halfpenny,'),\n",

But we have calculated it all, \\nDounia and I, to the last penny, and we see that the journey \\nwill not cost very much. It is only ninety versts from us to \\nthe railway and we have come to an agreement with a driver \\nwe know, so as to be in readiness; and from there Dounia \\nand I can travel quite comfortably third class.

She is an angel and you, Rodya, you are \\neverything to us—our one hope, our one consolation. If \\nonly you are happy, we shall be happy. Do you still say your \\nprayers, Rodya, and believe in the mercy of our Creator and \\nour Redeemer? I am afraid in my heart that you may have \\nbeen visited by the new spirit of infidelity that is abroad to-\\nday; If it is so, I pray for you.

He took up his hat and went out, \\nthis time without dread of meeting anyone; he had forgot-\\nten his dread.

And that very Dounia for that very ‘seems’ \\nis marrying him! Splendid! splendid!\\n‘… But I should like to know why mother has written to \\nme about ‘our most rising generation’? Simply as a descrip-\\ntive touch, or with the idea of prepossessing me in favour \\nof Mr. Luzhin? Oh, the cunning of them! I should like to \\nknow one thing more: how far they were open with one an-\\nother that day and night and all this time since? Was it all \\nput into words or did both understand that they had the \\nsame thing at heart and in their minds, so that there was \\nno need to speak of it aloud, and better not to speak of it. \\nMost likely it was partly like that, from mother’s letter it’s \\nevident: he struck her as rude a little and mother in her sim-\\nplicity took her observations to Dounia. And she was sure \\nto be vexed and ‘answered her angrily.’ I should think so! \\nWho would not be angered when it was quite clear without \\nany naïve questions and when it was understood that it was \\nuseless to discuss it. And why does she write to me, ‘love \\nDounia, Rodya, and she loves you more than herself’?

The chief thing is \\nhe is ‘a man of business and seems kind,’ that was some-\\nthing, wasn’t it, to send the bags and big box for them! A \\nkind man, no doubt after that! But his bride and her moth-\\ner are to drive in a peasant’s cart covered with sacking (I \\nknow, I have been driven in it). No matter! It is only nine-\\nty versts and then they can ‘travel very comfortably, third \\nclass,’ for a thousand versts! Quite right, too. One must cut \\none’s coat according to one’s cloth, but what about you, Mr. \\nLuzhin? She is your bride…. And you must be aware that \\nher mother has to raise money on her pension for the jour-\\nney. To be sure it’s a matter of business, a partnership for \\nmutual benefit, with equal shares and expenses;—food and \\ndrink provided, but pay for your tobacco.

How is it that \\nthey don’t both see all that, or is it that they don’t want to \\nsee? And they are pleased, pleased! And to think that this \\nis only the first blossoming, and that the real fruits are to \\ncome! But what really matters is not the stinginess, is not \\nthe meanness, but the tone of the whole thing. For that will \\nbe the tone after marriage, it’s a foretaste of it.
